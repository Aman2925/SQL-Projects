# 🍽️ Zomato SQL Analysis Project

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on performing **end-to-end SQL analysis** on a food delivery platform dataset inspired by **Zomato**. The objective is to extract meaningful business insights related to **orders, revenue, customers, restaurants, and rider performance** using structured SQL queries.

The project demonstrates strong SQL fundamentals along with **real-world problem handling**, including time-based analysis and performance evaluation.

---

## 📊 Business Objectives

* Analyze **order and revenue trends** across cities and restaurants
* Understand **customer ordering behavior and frequency**
* Evaluate **rider efficiency** using average delivery time metrics
* Identify **peak ordering periods** and high-performing locations
* Answer business-driven analytical questions using SQL

---

## 🗂️ Dataset Description

The dataset consists of multiple relational tables simulating a food delivery ecosystem:

* `customers` – customer details and identifiers
* `restaurants` – restaurant information and city mapping
* `orders` – order transactions with date and time details
* `deliveries` – delivery records including rider and delivery time
* `riders` – delivery partner information

The schema is designed using **primary and foreign keys** to represent real-world relationships.

---

## 🧠 Key Analysis Performed

* City-wise and restaurant-wise **total revenue analysis**
* Monthly and yearly **sales trend comparison**
* Order frequency analysis by **day of the week**
* Customer ordering pattern and repeat behavior analysis
* **Rider efficiency evaluation** using average delivery times
* Identification of fastest and slowest delivery partners

Special attention was given to **time-based challenges**, including:

* AM/PM time format conversion
* Handling **midnight crossover** cases in delivery time calculations

---

## 🛠️ SQL Concepts Used

* INNER & LEFT JOINs
* GROUP BY, HAVING
* Subqueries
* Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
* Window Functions (`RANK`, `LAG`, `AVG`)
* Date & Time Functions
* String-to-Time conversion
* Analytical and ranking queries
