# 🍽️ Zomato Food Delivery Analysis – SQL Project

## Project Overview

**Project Title**: Zomato Food Delivery Analysis
**Level**: Advanced
**Database**: `zomato_db`

This project demonstrates an **end-to-end SQL analytics case study** on a food delivery platform inspired by Zomato.
The analysis focuses on **customer behavior, restaurant performance, revenue trends, delivery efficiency, and time-based analytics**, solving real-world business problems using SQL.

The project showcases **advanced SQL querying, window functions, CTEs, time handling, and analytical thinking** commonly required in data analyst roles.

---

## Objectives

1. Analyze **customer ordering behavior and spending patterns**
2. Identify **top-performing restaurants, dishes, and cities**
3. Evaluate **order trends across time slots, days, months, and seasons**
4. Measure **rider efficiency and delivery performance**
5. Handle **real-world data challenges** such as AM/PM time formats and midnight delivery cases
6. Generate **business-driven insights** using SQL

---

## Database Overview

The database consists of multiple relational tables representing a food delivery ecosystem:

* `customers` – customer details and registration data
* `restaurants` – restaurant information and city mapping
* `orders` – order transactions including date, time, items, and amount
* `deliveries` – delivery details including rider and delivery time
* `riders` – delivery partner information

Relationships are maintained using **primary and foreign keys**, simulating real production-level data design.

---

## Database Setup

- ** Database Creation**: Created a database named `zomato_db`.
- **Table Creation**: Created tables for customers, restaurants, orders, deliveries, and riders. Each table includes relevant columns and relationships.

```sql
-- Creating Database

-- ZOMATO DATA ANALYSIS USING SQL

CREATE DATABASE zomato_db;

USE zomato_db;

-- CREATE Customer Table

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS customers;
CREATE TABLE customers 
	(
	    customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY,	
		customer_name VARCHAR(25),	
		reg_date DATE
	);

-- CREATE Restaurants Table
    
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS restaurants;
CREATE TABLE restaurants
	 (
		restaurant_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
        restaurant_name VARCHAR(55),
        city VARCHAR(25),
        opening_hours VARCHAR(55)
     );
     
-- CREATE Orders Table


DROP TABLE IF EXISTS orders;
CREATE TABLE orders
	 (
		order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
        customer_id INT,     -- FK
        restaurant_id INT,   -- FK
        order_item VARCHAR(45),
        order_date DATE,
        order_time VARCHAR(55),
        order_status VARCHAR(25),
        total_amount FLOAT
     );

-- CREATE Riders Table

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS riders;
CREATE TABLE riders 
	  (
		 rider_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
         rider_name VARCHAR(55),
         sign_up DATE
      );

-- CREATE Deliveries Table

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS deliveries;
CREATE TABLE deliveries
	  (
		delivery_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
        order_id INT, -- FK
        delivery_status VARCHAR(25),
        delivery_time VARCHAR(55),
        rider_id INT -- FK
	   );
       
       

-- ADDING CONSTRAINTS 

ALTER TABLE orders
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_customers
FOREIGN KEY (customer_id)
REFERENCES customers(customer_id);


ALTER TABLE orders
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_restaurant
FOREIGN KEY (restaurant_id)
REFERENCES restaurants(restaurant_id);

ALTER TABLE deliveries
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_orders
FOREIGN KEY (order_id)
REFERENCES orders(order_id);

ALTER TABLE deliveries
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_riders
FOREIGN KEY (rider_id)
REFERENCES riders(rider_id);

```


## Data Quality Checks

Before analysis, missing value checks were performed across all tables to ensure data integrity:

* Customers: name, registration date
* Restaurants: name, city, opening hours
* Orders: customer ID, restaurant ID, item, date, time, status, amount
* Deliveries: order ID, rider ID, delivery time, delivery status
* Riders: rider name, signup date

This step ensures **accurate and reliable analysis**.

## Analysis & SQL Tasks

** Task 1. Write a query to find the top 5 most frequently ordered dishes by customer called "Aman Singh" in the last 1 year.

```sql

SELECT 
	customer_name,
    dish_name,
	order_count
FROM
( -- table name
SELECT 
	c.customer_name,
    o.order_item as dish_name,
    COUNT(*) as order_count,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER(ORDER BY COUNT(*)DESC) AS rnk
FROM zomato_db.customers AS c
JOIN
zomato_db.orders AS o
ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
WHERE o.order_date >= (
		SELECT DATE_SUB(MAX(order_date),INTERVAL 1 YEAR)
		FROM 
		zomato_db.orders
) and c.customer_name = 'Aman Singh'
GROUP BY c.customer_name,
		 o.order_item
ORDER BY order_count DESC
) as t1
WHERE rnk <=5;

```

### 2️⃣ Popular Time Slots Analysis

** Identify the time slots during which the most orders are placed. based on 2-hour intervals.

```sql
SELECT 
    CASE 
        WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM order_time) BETWEEN 0 AND 1 THEN '00:00 - 02:00'
        WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM order_time) BETWEEN 2 AND 3 THEN '02:00 - 04:00'
        WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM order_time) BETWEEN 4 AND 5 THEN '04:00 - 06:00'
        WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM order_time) BETWEEN 6 AND 7 THEN '06:00 - 08:00'
        WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM order_time) BETWEEN 8 AND 9 THEN '08:00 - 10:00'
        WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM order_time) BETWEEN 10 AND 11 THEN '10:00 - 12:00'
        WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM order_time) BETWEEN 12 AND 13 THEN '12:00 - 14:00'
        WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM order_time) BETWEEN 14 AND 15 THEN '14:00 - 16:00'
        WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM order_time) BETWEEN 16 AND 17 THEN '16:00 - 18:00'
        WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM order_time) BETWEEN 18 AND 19 THEN '18:00 - 20:00'
        WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM order_time) BETWEEN 20 AND 21 THEN '20:00 - 22:00'
        WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM order_time) BETWEEN 22 AND 23 THEN '22:00 - 00:00'
    END AS time_slot,
    COUNT(order_id) AS order_count
FROM zomato_db.orders
GROUP BY time_slot
ORDER BY order_count DESC;


-- Approach 2

SELECT 
    FLOOR(EXTRACT(HOUR FROM order_time)/2) * 2 AS start_time,
    FLOOR(EXTRACT(HOUR FROM order_time)/2) * 2 + 2 AS end_time,
    COUNT(order_id) AS order_count
FROM zomato_db.orders
GROUP BY start_time, end_time
ORDER BY order_count DESC;

```
